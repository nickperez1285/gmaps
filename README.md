### [Week 6: Object-Oriented Design](week-6)

## Expectations for the Unit

- [Peer-Pair program](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/peer-pairing_sessions.md) **at least 6 times**. Read about [pairing](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/pairing-in-phase-0.md) before hand.
- [Submit feedback](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback/new) for all pairing sessions. (You should submit 6 for peer sessions and 1 for [GPS 2.1](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/guided-pairing-sessions.md))

## [Resources](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/resources.md)
We highly recommend the following books for this unit. We aren't requiring you to purchase them, they are just great books to have in your library for really getting to know the ins and outs of Ruby and object-oriented design.
- [The Well-Grounded Rubyist](http://www.manning.com/black2/)
- [Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby](http://www.poodr.com/)
